        <h1>Seville: Capital of Andalusia</h1>
        <p>Seville (Spanish: Sevilla) is the capital of Andalusia, Spain's autonomous community. It sits on the lower Guadalquivir River in the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
        <p>With a population of around 701,000 (2022), Seville is Andalusia's largest city and Spain's fourth-largest. Its historic center, covering 4 square kilometers, features UNESCO-listed sites: the Alcázar palace complex, the Cathedral, and the General Archive of the Indies.</p>
        <p>Seville's history includes Roman roots as Hispalis, Islamic influence as Ishbiliyah, and prominence during the Spanish Empire. The 20th century saw significant cultural events like the 1929 Ibero-American Exposition and Expo '92.</p>
        <p>The city's name evolved from Hisbaal to Hispalis and later to Seville. The city's motto, NO8DO, means "She has not abandoned me," symbolizing support for King Alfonso X. The emblem appears on Seville's flag and various landmarks.</p>
        <p>Seville's history spans over 2,200 years, leaving a well-preserved historical center. The city's founding is linked to Hercules (Heracles) and ancient trading posts. The core dates back to the 8th century BC, situated on an island in the Guadalquivir River.</p>
